# lingua-franca

English is the most-spoken language in the world, with almost twice as many non-native speakers as there are native speakers. English is also the lingua franca of coding, and even some languages developed in non-English speaking countries (e.g. Ruby and Python) use English for keywords.

For this piece, I imagined what Javascript (perhaps the most widely used coding language, according to StackOverflow's 2020 developer survey) would be like if it were written in Spanish. I chose to translate the Array class, since that's a common non-primitive datatype, and I chose Spanish because I speak it. The methods I translated were not carefully chosen, but rather the first few I could think of.
