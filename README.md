# code-as-art

When I first learned that software was protected under copyright law, I was ecstatic. I loved that my work was legally treated as art. For a brief moment, I considered introducing myself as an author rather than an engineer. I've since learned more about copyright and patent law and how those apply to code, but the concept of code-as-art continues to fascinate me.

This repo is an art gallery of my work. The code found here isn't necessarily meant to be useful or do anything, and my design choices are intentional. Some of this code may be clunky and unreadable, and some may be oversimplistic or non-functioning. In my eyes, this is meant as poetry.

I'll divide up pieces into folders, and I'll include a README file in each folder to give a brief artist's description of each piece. However, this art is open to interpretation, and any meaning you take from it is perfectly valid.
